# szq: Swift ZeroMQ Bindings - An Opinionated Approach

**szq** is an opinionated Swift library for using [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org), also known as ZMQ.
It draws inspiration from its [C++ equivalent, zq](https://github.com/a4z/zq), adhering to a shared philosophy:
Provide essential functionality that covers most use cases while remaining flexible and extendable for project-specific needs.

## About

While several ZeroMQ Swift bindings already exist, none met my expectations.

Most bindings aim to wrap the entire ZMQ interface, which I find unnecessary for many applications.
In real-world projects, developers often know which patterns and ZMQ features they need to use.

**szq** takes a different approach:

- It demonstrates how to "fish" üê† instead of handing you pre-caught fishes üòâ.
- It provides a streamlined interface for most, if not all, common use cases.
- When advanced functionality is needed, it doesn‚Äôt stand in your way.

The result is a library that simplifies usage without sacrificing flexibility.

## Consuming ZeroMQ

**szq** depends on ZeroMQ.

For convenience, it uses the ZeroMQ XCFramework available at [libzmq-xcf](https://github.com/a4z/libzmq-xcf).

## Platform Support

- **Apple Platforms**: Fully supported.
- **Linux**: Support is in progress and coming soon.
